Can you tell me more about the challenges you face when managing visits to the healthcare system?</voice>"},{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"<voice emotion=\"frustrated\">One of the biggest issues is the long queues at the NFZ clinics. My father often can't stand for long periods.</voice>"},{"speaker":"CUSTOMER_SERVICE","content":"<voice emotion=\"empathetic\"><break time=\"300ms\"/>I see, that must be very difficult for both of you.

How do you manage those situations when he becomes angry?</voice>"},{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"<voice emotion=\"calm\"><break time=\"200ms\"/>I try to remain calm and reassure him, but it can be tough.
