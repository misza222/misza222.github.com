{"title":"Interview with an Adult Child of an Elderly Patient","dialogue":[{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"Hi, I'm here to talk about my experience with my elderly parent visiting the local NFZ clinic."},{"speaker":"CUSTOMER_SERVICE","content":"Of course! Can you tell me about what challenges your parent faces when visiting the clinic?"},{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"Well, the first major issue is that the clinics are huge, and my parent often gets lost trying to find the registration desk."},{"speaker":"CUSTOMER_SERVICE","content":"That sounds frustrating. How does your parent usually navigate through the clinic?"},{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"They usually try to remember where things are, but with their memory issues, it becomes really difficult for them."},{"speaker":"CUSTOMER_SERVICE","content":"I can imagine. Have they ever asked someone for help when they feel lost?"},{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"Yes, sometimes they do, but it can be hard to find someone to ask, or they don’t want to bother others."},{"speaker":"CUSTOMER_SERVICE","content":"What about signs or maps in the clinic? Do they find those helpful?"},{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"Not really. The signs can be confusing and my parent often has a hard time understanding them."},{"speaker":"CUSTOMER_SERVICE","content":"I see. And what happens when they finally get to the registration desk?"},{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"The staff there are usually quite busy, and my parent might forget their appointment details or feel rushed."},{"speaker":"CUSTOMER_SERVICE","content":"That sounds stressful. Do you ever accompany them to the appointments?"},{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"I try to, but with my work schedule, it's hard to be there every time."},{"speaker":"CUSTOMER_SERVICE","content":"What do you think would help make the process easier for your parent?"},{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"Having someone available to guide them through the clinic would be ideal, or even a helper service for elderly patients."},{"speaker":"CUSTOMER_SERVICE","content":"That sounds like a great idea. Is there anything else you think could improve their experience?"},{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"More staff dedicated to helping patients navigate the clinic would make a huge difference."}]}
