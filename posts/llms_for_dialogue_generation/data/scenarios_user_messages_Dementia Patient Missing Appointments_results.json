{"title":"Customer Discovery Interview with a Family Member of a Patient with Dementia","dialogue":[{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"Hi, I'm really struggling to manage my relative's medical appointments. They often forget when and where to go."},{"speaker":"CUSTOMER_SERVICE","content":"That sounds very challenging. Could you tell me more about the typical issues you face with their appointments?"},{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"Sure. Sometimes they forget the time of the appointment completely, and often they don't know what documents they need to bring."},{"speaker":"CUSTOMER_SERVICE","content":"I see. How do you currently remind them of their appointments?"},{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"I try to call them or send them messages, but they often can't remember the information or get confused."},{"speaker":"CUSTOMER_SERVICE","content":"That must be frustrating. Do they recognize the clinic when you arrive?"},{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"Not always. Sometimes they forget the way or the name of the clinic, so we spend a lot of time just trying to find the right place."},{"speaker":"CUSTOMER_SERVICE","content":"How do you handle it when they can't remember where to go?"},{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"I usually have to go with them, but I have a busy schedule, and my siblings are also busy."},{"speaker":"CUSTOMER_SERVICE","content":"Have you ever considered using any kind of reminders or technology to assist with this?"},{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"I've thought about it, but I’m not sure which tools would work best for someone with dementia."},{"speaker":"CUSTOMER_SERVICE","content":"What kind of support do you think would help you the most in this situation?"},{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"Maybe having someone who could assist us at the clinic would be helpful. Just someone who knows what to do."},{"speaker":"CUSTOMER_SERVICE","content":"That sounds like a great idea. Would you prefer this assistance to be available on-site at the clinic or remotely through a phone app or service?"},{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"On-site would be best since they need physical help navigating."},{"speaker":"CUSTOMER_SERVICE","content":"Thank you for sharing this with me. Is there anything else that you think could improve the experience for both you and your relative?"},{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"Just having clearer communication from the clinic about what they need and when would really help as well."}]}
