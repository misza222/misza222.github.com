My father often can't stand for long periods."},{"speaker":"CUSTOMER_SERVICE","content":"I see, that must be very difficult for both of you. How does he react during these long waits?"},{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"He gets frustrated easily, especially when he doesn't understand what’s happening or what he needs to do next."},{"speaker":"CUSTOMER_SERVICE","content":"That sounds challenging. How do you manage those situations when he becomes angry?"},{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"I try to remain calm and reassure him, but it can be tough. Sometimes he just doesn't want to cooperate anymore."},{"speaker":"CUSTOMER_SERVICE","content":"Have you found any strategies or support that help during these visits?"},{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"Not really. I often feel overwhelmed and wish there were more resources available to assist elderly patients like him."},{"speaker":"CUSTOMER_SERVICE","content":"Is it difficult for you to navigate the system as well, in finding the right department or person?"},{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"Yes, very much so. Sometimes we go to the wrong room and then have to start all over again."},{"speaker":"CUSTOMER_SERVICE","content":"That sounds frustrating. How does this impact his healthcare access?"},{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"It makes it harder for him to get the help he needs regularly. Sometimes we just give up altogether."},{"speaker":"CUSTOMER_SERVICE","content":"What improvements do you think could be made to help you and others in similar situations?"},{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"Having someone to assist with navigation would be helpful, maybe a dedicated caretaker for elderly patients."},{"speaker":"CUSTOMER_SERVICE","content":"That’s a great suggestion. Would you be open to exploring solutions that could provide that support?"},{"speaker":"CLIENT","content":"Absolutely. Anything that makes it easier for us would be welcome."}]}
